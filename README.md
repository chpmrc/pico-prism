# PicoPrism

This is a simple serverless (using Zappa) Flask-based app to manipulate images on the fly.

It aims at emulating the Prism service (tryprism.com). Only a subset of the features are implemented so far. No S3 necessary.

**Demo**: https://qt049q80mf.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev

**Note**: this is *not* production ready.

## Isn't this slower?
